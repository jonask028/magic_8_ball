The goal of this project is to code a program that, when given an input, randomly selects and returns one of 8 strings.

You will write a program to simulate a Magic 8-Ball (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball). You program should:

1. Prompt the user to enter a question for the Magic 8-ball

    Ask the magic 8 ball a question: (press enter to quit)
        If the user presses Enter without entering any text, the program will quit.

2. The program should return a random response from the following options:
"It is certain"

"Outlook good"

"You may rely on it"

"Ask again later"

"Concentrate and ask again"

"Reply hazy, try again"

"My reply is no"

"My sources say no"
